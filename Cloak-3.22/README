ROOT-THEME:
Open ROOT-THEME folder and copy or symlink the 'Cloak-3.20' folder inside to Root's home folder, in the '.themes' folder (/root/.themes/).
The Normal 'Cloack-3.22' theme must then be installed to your home folder inside the '.themes' ($HOME/.themes) folder for this to work.
If there is no '.themes' folder please create them.

Firefox:
Open Firefox folder and copy or symlink the 'chrome' folder located inside to '$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/xSomeNumbers.default'.
Restart Firefox for the changes to take effect.  This theme displaying correctly depends on 'Cloak-3.22' being selected as Gtk theme.
To Remove:
Simply move the 'chrome' folder inside '$HOME/.mozilla/firefox/xSomeNumbers.default' to the trash.

gnome-shell-GDM:
Open '/usr/share/gnome-shell/' and backup the 'gnome-shell-theme.gresource' file.
Next open 'gnome-shell-GDM' folder inside the 'Cloak-3.22' folder and copy or symlink the 'gnome-shell-theme.gresource' file to '/usr/share/gnome-shell/'.
The new theme will be installed when you restart.
*NOTE- Any update to Gnome-Shell will erase the theme file and return it to the Adwaita default, you will need to reinstall.
*NOTE- If you would like to change the background of the GDM screen to match you wallpaper or other, please refer to this article:
